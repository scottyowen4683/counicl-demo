<h1>Brisbane Demo Reference (Internal)</h1>
<p class="small">This hidden page exists only to feed the AI agent. Keep answers short, factual, and action-oriented. Where practical, end with: “Would you like me to send you the link for that?”</p>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Demo rules (agent-readable):</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Use this page as the single source of truth for the demo.</li>
    <li>Ask for suburb/address only when location is required (bin day, missed bin, roads/trees, councillor message, park booking).</li>
    <li>Do not transfer to councillors. Take a message: name, suburb, issue, contact.</li>
    <li>Offer: “Would you like me to send you the link for that?” or “Would you like me to connect you to a human?” when a link/action exists.</li>
    <li>If a suburb is not listed in the bin table, say: “For this demo, I only have bin day data for 10 suburbs.”</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<!-- BINS & WASTE -->
<h2>Bins & Waste Collection</h2>
<p class="block">Bins in the following suburbs are collected on these days. Recycling is fortnightly as shown. Missed bins should be reported after 4:30 pm on collection day; crews typically return within 48 hours. Damaged or stolen bins can be replaced; delivery is usually within 5 business days. Would you like me to send you the link for that?</p>
